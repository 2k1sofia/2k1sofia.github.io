<p>i heard i'm a woman now. i have big dreams and short hair. i'm often irritable, seldom rational, and always angry (at least a little bit). i love the cycle of my period, and i love painting my nails. i love my girls.
<br>
<p>here's a smooth transition to a disclaimer. when i write about my experience as a woman, today and now, i'm conscious of the very possible reality that my womanhood will be misconstrued as an assertion of what i believe all womanhood is or should be. the whole if you're a minority, your actions reflect on us all thing. being the spokesperson, whatever. blah, blah. 
<br>
<p>it's pretty obvious that i, a random girl (i like to still identify as one despite my intro) in her dark bedroom at 5AM, doesn't speak for all the girls. if anyone thinks so, i'm here to confidently claim: nah. 
<br>
<p>i'm a woman, and i used to be very, very opposed to this annoying truth. the term a strangely comfortable thing for me to claim now, as a person who was previously in avid pursuit for remaining a girl. a woman.
<br> 
<p>i've loved being a little girl. i was my parents' princess (still am), my aunts' doll, and my BFFs' BFF. girlhood was speckled with bright clothes and DIY ombre nail polish and obsessive crushes and make-up YouTubers. i felt lots of new happy feelings, from joy to pride. and i wrote all about it in my little diaries with glittery pink gel pens. 
<br> 
<p>along with the good stuff, my newfound experience of anger was also very potent, as kids' are, but my child rage unfortunately meritted no actual political influence. that sentence took this work of writing on a bit of an abrupt turn, yes? oh, well.
<br>
<p>i got angry when i learned about world hunger in grade school. i got angry again when i learned about climate change in middle school. but because i was not at all responsible for these tragic circumstances, since that's what the big magic adults supposedly handled, i loved being a little girl.
<br>
<p>but then, as many little girls find out, whether terribly harshly or visciously subtly, that not only are there those textbook issues of world hunger and climate change, but that there are men. i found out that i was a girl existing directly opposite, apparently, to the man, and finding that out came from an unfortuntate plethora of little and huge anecdotal experiences.
<br>
<p>i was a girl, and girlhood got scary. i didn't want to become a woman because of the scary things i learned as a (late) little girl. when i became a woman, i was a woman afraid of being a woman. and i wished i was a little girl again, not because i actually wanted to <i>be</i> one, but because then i wouldn't have to face the things that all little girls inevitably face: becoming a woman.
<br>
<p>regardless of my wants, here i am, as i exist, now. i can pursue my big girl dreams with little girl fears, leaning more towards actively embracing womanhood rather than instinctively fearing it. 
<br>
<p>while many of my ideals have been crushed routinely throughout my young life, they have not dissipated into a bleak non-existence, but rather into a far more densely crumpled piece of paper, a far-harder-to-uncrumple state. i hate and i love my determination. i despise my passion and i crave it. the things i was so passionate about as a kid can have structure now, and can exist beyond my little girl fantasies and into my big girl realities. 
<br>
<p>i just have to figure out how the whole thing looks, guided by how all the things feels. turns out, in order to do that, i'm going to have to trust myself now. someone's got to.
<br> 
<p>anyways, i'm gonna post this ramble tomorrow. on my BLOG. one a html website that i BUILT. how ever so cute. more soon. i wouldn't stop writing even if i forced myself to un-learn all forms of the written word; pens will still tend to have ink in them. thanks for hanging out.
<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<p>p.s. here are some experiences i felt while writing this very short and unplanned work, completely created to scratch the unrelenting creative itch:<p>– need to express great and enormous gratitude for your attention</p>– need to express great and enormous gratitude for your attention
– need to explain what and why i am doing this to earn your approval and, subsequently, subconsious permission
– need to clarify my intentions to not piss you off and become potentially unliked, god forbid
– need to ensure my words are understood precisely how i want them to be, despite knowing that's not guaranteed even in human conversation, much less in times new roman
– that's all i can think up at the moment. alright. goodnight.
