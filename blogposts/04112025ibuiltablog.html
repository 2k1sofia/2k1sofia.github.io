<p>i'm a woman. i have big dreams and short hair. i'm often irritable, seldom rational, and always angry (at least a little bit). i love the cycle of my period, and i love painting my nails. what am i on about?
<br>
<p> here's some disclaimer. when i write about my experience as a woman, today and now, i'm conscious of the very possible reality that my womanhood will be misconstrued as an assertion of what i believe all womanhood is or should be. the whole if you're a minority, your actions reflect on us all thing. being the spokesperson, whatever. blah, blah.
