<p>it's becoming very apparent that i'm an angry woman. i'm often irritable, seldom rational (as if being rational is cool anyways), and always frustrated. i used to never be angry, i'd think, wrongfully so. i'm a girl of big dreams and short hair. am i sad and anxious? sure, but i'm hopeful in general. i'm jealous, dare i say, and easily annoyed, yes. but angry? no.<br>
<p>here's a smooth transition to a disclaimer. when i write about my experience as an angry woman, today and now, i'm conscious of the very possible reality that <i>my</i> womanhood will be misconstrued as an assertion of what i believe <i>all</i> womanhood is or should be. the whole <i>if you're a minority, your actions reflect on us all!</i> thing. whatever. women aren't even minorities in the literal sense. blah, blah, blah. i'm writing what i know, and i know me (at least a little bit).<br>
<p>it's next paragraph time. i'm an angry woman, but i had no idea of this truth until recently. i always thought i was just <i>sad.</i> a sad, sad girl. girls felt cute and happy, or sad and moody. i could be caring and sweet, or quiet and passive-aggressive. that's about where my emotional range has lived, until i came to a certain consciousness of my womanhood in the form of a song (more on this song later) – i was actually very, very angry.<br>
<p>i got angry pretty often as a kid, but there was no real meaning there other than, <i>look!</i> she's developing basic human empathy. i got angry when i learned about world hunger in grade school. i got angry again when i learned about climate change in middle school. but i was a kid, and Greta Thunberg aside, kids are not inclined to skip school and change the world.<br>
<p>the most change i believe i ever personally enacted was wearing down my pencil tips. i scribbled very furiously in my High School Musical diary: <i>kids are HUNGRY!!! world hunger SUCKS! I HATE THIS!</i> and then i closed my diary, ate some dinner, and went to bed.<br>
<p>as many little girls also find out, on top of world dilemmas, whether harshly or subtly, <i>men</i> also exist. i'm sure every girl recalls a young personal moment of, <i>oh</i>, [insert an injustice here, whether criminal or subtle] is happening to me because i'm a <i>girl</i>. bummer!<br>
<p>Baby Girl Little Sofia has experienced being Mad. been-there, done-that. so why do i care about Grown Woman Hot and Sexy Sofia being Mad <i>now?</i><br>
<p>turns out, B.G.L. Sofia internalized all her sadness and anger. i hear this is common with the ladies. inside you go, shame and sadness and frustration! into our pretty bodies and minds, tucked away and seething. how very considerate of us.<br>
<p>boys, on the other hand... you know what, i have no idea how little boys process sadness. but i do know that many grown men <i>externalize</i> their sadness by yelling at their girlfriends or throwing very heavy weights onto the ground for the whole gym to hear. <i>outwards</i> it goes, in a super un-sexy way. either anger went inside or out, and both ways looked pretty dangerous and terrifying.<br>
<p>but then, i wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W3_kEP2lvE">this song</a>. listening to it now, you can easily tell it's all about being pissy (not-derogatory), rightfully and adamantly so. for me, personally, this deep understanding came <i>much</i> later. it was only <i>after</i> the whole song was over and done with, sang over and over and over in my room, that i realized: <i>oh, LOL, this isn't about being sad. it's about being really fucking pissed...ah. this is what anger can look like... very cool.  </i><br>
<p>song-writing has greatly helped me process my human experience since i was a wee child, and a large part of that process is not really knowing what it is i'm processing until the song's all done. then you can go, oh, right. that's what i was talking about. a funny thing, song-writing. everyone has their own ways of understanding things that they don't really understand themselves.<br>
<p>as a woman well-acquainted to sad songs, meeting my first angry one was an empowering and validating experience. i'm also historically quite gullible, so i sometimes take a while to catch up on things.<br>
<p>nowadays, my anger is allowed to be loud, abrasive, and justified. is it often? not yet, but at least i'm aware of my newfound capability. i get to do and say things as an woman that i never could as an angry little girl. this includes writing with more readers than me in mind, eating food with, like, love rather than hate, and – connected to but seemingly differently from the first two – working to ensure my curated safe inner worlds matched the unruly dangerous outside ones. the things i wanted so passionately as a kid can have purposeful structure now, and are being realized beyond my little girl fantasies and into my big girl realities.<br>
<p>the anger can go outwards, ladies. especially for women, the expression of this feeling mustn't be demonized, dismissed, or internalized. the stuff can be very potent and fuel better, happier truths for little baby girls everywhere.<br>
<p>how exciting. i'm gonna post this on my B-B-B-BLOG! i guess when you're reading this, it'll already be up. isn't this cool? you're on a html website that i BUILT. how ever so STEM of me. thank you to GitHub.<br>
<p>anyways, more soon. i couldn't stop writing even if i forced myself to un-learn all forms of the written word. pens will still tend to have ink in them. so, thanks for hanging out. i appreciate it <3</p><br>
