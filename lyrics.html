i gotta see it through<br>
in my head, it's long overdue<br> 
collecting dust in mental warfare, the silent blues<br>
but when i sing, i got nothing to prove<br>
<br>
so, now, i see me through, i've been<br> 
caught up in all your talk, projecting<br>
so much shame, no one to blame<br>
but that toxic green<br>
<br>
could you keep it to yourself<br> 
and let me speak?<br>
<br>
i don't care who you are<br> 
if you overstep or disrespect me,<br> 
catch me on guard, yeah,<br>
i see what's in the room<br>
upholding upbringings<br>
but that don't mean i consume<br> 
what you been tryna feed me<br>
<br>
no, i don't care who you are<br> 
cause in the end, we are one and the same, all once a babe<br>
i love me, love me, in scary totality<br>
so if you can't love you, i won't let you take it out on me<br>
<br>
don't try me, don't you dare<br>
i weaponize silence, i move in stealth<br>
but i no longer want to,<br> 
i'm tryna vocalize it<br>
so heed my words and keep em close<br>
'cause you can't keep my personhood<br>
we stay good<br>
<br>
because i see me through<br>
in my head, it's long overdue<br> 
collecting dust in mental warfare<br>
the silent blues<br>
but when i sing, baby, i got nothing to prove<br>
<br>
so now i see me through, i've been<br> 
caught up in all your talk, projecting<br>
so much shame, no one to blame<br>
but that toxic green<br>
<br>
could you keep it to yourself<br>
and let me breathe?<br> 
<br>
where does my anger go?<br>
when i don't wanna be forgiving<br>
don't care for your perceiving<br>
of what i shouldn't do<br>
and of what i shouldn't say<br>
who doesn't make mistakes?<br>
lend me a little grace<br>
<br>
where does my anger go?<br>
no, we never hurt alone<br>
so why'd you throw the first stone? isn't my,<br> 
isn't my voice my own?<br>
<br>
could you watch your tone?<br>
i'm telling you to hear what you say<br>
when you spew your hate, you're revealing<br> 
what you see in the mirror<br>
what you feel when you're sober<br>
what you deal with in the darkness<br>
what you think you know is righteous<br>
<br>
why you dead set on being correct?<br>
who you tryna prove wrong in your head?<br>
you're not alone in this world<br>
no matter what you did<br>
no matter what happened<br>
so no matter what<br>
<br>
i'm gonna see me through<br>
in my head, it's long overdue<br> 
collecting dust in mental warfare<br>
the silent blues<br>
but when i sing, i got nothing to prove<br>
<br>
so now i see me through, i've been<br> 
caught up in all your talk, projecting<br>
so much shame, no one to blame<br>
but that toxic peace<br>
<br>
could you keep it to yourself<br>
and let me be?<br>
<br>
the sun shines without permission<br>
the sun shines without permission<br>
the sun shines without permission<br>
the sun shines<br>
the sun shines<br> 
the sun shines<br>    
<br>
the sun shines without permission<br>
the sun shines without permission<br>
the sun shines without permission<br>
the sun shines<br>
the sun shines<br>
<br>
the sun shines<br>
<br>

   <p align=left><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☆♫♥︎ <u>take care of the minutes</u></b><br>
i dream about a life i know i'll never have<br>
i dream about a girl in her pigtails and her bangs<br>
<br>
no, i can't change what happened<br>
but i can live with it<br>
it was never my fault<br>
but my body thinks it is<br>
<br>
so, i'll just take care of the minutes<br>
let the hours just go ahead and take care of themselves<br>
<br>
oh, i'll just take care of the minutes, every minute<br>
hoping time tells all despite all the times it had to stand still<br> 
<br>
the weight on my shoulders like to tell me that i can't laugh<br>
demands of your normal would like me to go and forego my past<br>
no, i can't forget but i can forgive<br> 
and i can learn to love and i can see the gift<br>
of every day<br>
of every day<br>
<br>
that doesn't mean<br>
i don't miss the days of fluid bliss<br>
the days of eskimo kisses<br>
and tugging on earlobes<br>
and falling in love with<br> 
all the things i now cope with<br>
<br>
it is what it is<br> 
<br>
so, i'll just take care of the minutes<br> 
let the hours just go ahead and take care of themselves<br> 
<br>
i know i could've ended up so different<br>
<br>
so, how'd you do it, love?<br>
how'd you learn to love yourself?<br>
<br>
when, in a matter of seconds, the sky fell, caved in on itself<br>
i shoved out of my cloud and into a silent hell<br>
i started setting my own fires and walking through my flames<br>
who was i if i wasn't inflicting my own pain?<br>
<br>
hm, at least this time, it's i who's in control<br>
<br>
i thought<br>
at least this time, it's i who's in<br>
at least this time, it's i who's in<br>
<br>
i thought<br> 
at least this time, it's i who's in control<br>
<br>
but i swear i'm trying<br>
to let that thought go<br>
<br>
so i'll just take care of the minutes<br>
let the present go by without the past toppling over the shelves<br>
<br>
i know that i could've ended up so different<br>
<br>
but i gotta do it, love<br>
i had to learn to love myself<br>
<br>
you gotta do it, love<br> 
there's no point in wanting to be anyone else<br>
<br>
we gotta do it , love<br>
again and again<br> 
and again and a-<br>
again and again<br>
and again and a-<br>
<br>
again and again,<br>
i'll fall in love with myself<br>
<br>
how'd you do it, love?<br>
<br>
