    <p align=left><u>take care of the minutes</u><br>
      
i dream about a life i know i'll never have<br>
i dream about a girl in her pigtails and her bangs<br>
<br>
no, i can't change what happened<br>
but i can live with it<br>
it was never my fault<br>
but my body thinks it is<br>
<br>
so, i'll just take care of the minutes<br>
let the hours just go ahead and take care of themselves<br>

oh, i'll just take care of the minutes, every minute<br>
hoping time tells all despite all the times it had to stand still<br> 


the weight on my shoulders like to tell me that i can't laugh<br>
demands of your normal would like me to go and forego my past<br>
no, i can't forget but i can forgive<br> 
and i can learn to love and i can see the gift<br>
of every day<br>
of every day<br>

that doesn't mean<br>
i don't miss the days of fluid bliss<br>
the days of eskimo kisses<br>
and tugging on earlobes<br>
and falling in love with<br> 
all the things i now cope with<br>

it is what it is<br> 


so, i'll just take care of the minutes<br> 
let the hours just go ahead and take care of themselves<br> 

i know i could've ended up so different<br>

so, how'd you do it, love?<br>
how'd you learn to love yourself?<br>


when, in a matter of seconds, the sky fell, caved in on itself<br>
i shoved out of my cloud and into a silent hell<br>
i started setting my own fires and walking through my flames<br>
who was i if i wasn't inflicting my own pain?<br>

hm, at least this time, it's i who's in control<br>

i thought<br>
at least this time, it's i who's in<br>
at least this time, it's i who's in<br>

i thought<br> 
at least this time, it's i who's in control<br>

but i swear i'm trying<br>
to let that thought go<br>

      
so i'll just take care of the minutes<br>
let the present go by without the past toppling over the shelves<br>

i know that i could've ended up so different<br>

but i gotta do it, love<br>
i had to learn to love myself<br>

you gotta do it, love<br> 
there's no point in wanting to be anyone else<br>

we gotta do it , love<br>
again and again<br> 
and again and a-<br>
again and again<br>
and again and a-<br>

again and again,<br>
i'll fall in love with myself<br>

how'd you do it, love?<br>
