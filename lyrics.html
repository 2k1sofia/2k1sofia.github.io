i dream about a life i know i'll never have
i dream about a girl in her pigtails and her bangs


no, i can't change what happened 
but i can live with it
it was never my fault 
but my body thinks it is

so, i'll just take care of the minutes
let the hours just go ahead and take care of themselves

oh, i'll just take care of the minutes, every minute
hoping time tells all despite all the times it had to stand still 


the weight on my shoulders like to tell me that i can't laugh
demands of your normal would like me to go and forego my past
no, i can't forget but i can forgive 
and i can learn to love and i can see the gift
of every day
of every day

that doesn't mean
i don't miss the days of fluid bliss
the days of eskimo kisses
and tugging on earlobes
and falling in love with 
all the things i now cope with

it is what it is 


so, i'll just take care of the minutes 
let the hours just go ahead and take care of themselves 

i know i could've ended up so different

so, how'd you do it, love?
how'd you learn to love yourself?


when, in a matter of seconds, the sky fell, caved in on itself
i shoved out of my cloud and into a silent hell
i started setting my own fires and walking through my flames
who was i if i wasn't inflicting my own pain?

hm, at least this time, it's i who's in control

i thought
at least this time, it's i who's in
at least this time, it's i who's in

i thought 
at least this time, it's i who's in control

but i swear i'm trying
to let that thought go


so i'll just take care of the minutes
let the present go by without the past toppling over the shelves

i know that i could've ended up so different

but i gotta do it, love
i had to learn to love myself

you gotta do it, love 
there's no point in wanting to be anyone else

we gotta do it , love
again and again 
and again and a-
again and again 
and again and a-

again and again,
i'll fall in love with myself

how'd you do it, love?
